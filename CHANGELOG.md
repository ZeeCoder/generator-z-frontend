# Change Log

Note that although I use semver-ish version numbers, since it's my personal
project I tend to introduce changed behavior in minor releases.

Also: since it's a generator, it won't really "break" anything, it's just that
the generated output could differ a lot between minor releases.

Hovewer, now you can keep track of these changes here. ;)  

## 2.1.0
- Added this CHANGELOG.md file
- Added the mixins/ and functions/ folders
- Removed the overwrites/ folder
- Added the "em" sass functions: `em`, `em-base`
