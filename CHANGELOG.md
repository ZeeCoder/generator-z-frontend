# Change Log

Note that although I use semver-ish version numbers, since it's my personal
project I tend to introduce changed behavior in minor releases.

Also: since it's a generator, it won't really "break" anything, it's just that
the generated output could differ a lot between minor releases.

Hovewer, now you can keep track of these changes here. ;)
