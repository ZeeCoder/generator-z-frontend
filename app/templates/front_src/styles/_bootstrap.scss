// This file should contain @imports, configuration variables and other generic
// stuffs like that.
// The listed "groups" here - like Other/Includes, etc - don't have to follow
// each other strictly in this order.
// Feel free to switch around variables, imports and anything as needed.

// === 3rd party ===
// Configuration variables could be placed here, so that variables marked as
// !default can be overwritten.
// ...
@import "sass-mediaqueries/media-queries";
@import "bourbon/app/assets/stylesheets/bourbon";

// === Colors ===
// All colors on the site must be saved here as a variable.
// The variables must be prefixed with "c-", and the name must be the color's
// name. For inspiration on the color names, you can use this:
// http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color
// Also, the color name must be in all lowercase, with the syllables separated
// by a dash. (Ex.: "$c-this-is-a-color")
// This convention is based on the following discussion: https://trello.com/c/zJwuLnvf
$c-white: #fff;
$c-black: #000;

// === Z-indexes ===
// For popups, overlays and other componenst placed "over" the standard content
// a z-index is always declared. By collecting these z-indexes here, you can
// organise them better. (It does not mean to collect every single z-indexes
// here, only those that could potentially overlap with each other.)
// $z-overlay-menu: 200;

// === Fonts ===
// Fonts should be stored in the "fonts/" folder inside the public folder.
// The following bourbon mixin will generate the proper css ruleset.
// It will search the "CustomFont" folder for files like: "CustomFont.ttf",
// "CustomFont.woff", etc.
// @include font-face(CustomFont, "../fonts/CustomFont/CustomFont");

// === Includes ===
// $g-fallback-font: "Open Sans", Arial, sans-serif;
@import "functions/ff";
@import "functions/hash-to-rgba";
@import "functions/em";
@import "functions/em-base";

// Only very basic rules should be placed here.
// Ex.: rules for certain tags, like the "body", disabling the "focus outline"
// on buttons/textareas, etc.
body {
    font-family: $g-fallback-font;
    font-size: 15px;
    line-height: 30px;
    color: $c-black;
    -webkit-font-smoothing: antialiased;
