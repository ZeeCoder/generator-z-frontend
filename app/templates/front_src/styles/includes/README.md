In this folder, only mixins and functions can be placed.
Every mixin and function must have a separate file, and the
filename must be the mixin's / function's name, prefixed with an
underscore, having the following syllables separated by a dash.
Ex.: "_my-mixin.scss", which contains the "my-mixin" mixin.
