// All colors on the site must be saved here as a variable.
// The variables must be prefixed with "c-", and the name must be the color's
// name. For inspiration on the color names, you can use this:
// http://chir.ag/projects/name-that-color
// Also, the color name must be in all lowercase, with the syllables separated
// by a dash. (Ex.: "$c-this-is-a-color")
// This convention is based on: https://trello.com/c/zJwuLnvf
$c-white: #fff;
$c-black: #000;
